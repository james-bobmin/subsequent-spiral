## The Wabi Sabi Secret

In slowly peeling back the layers of mystery, this is what I have come to understand: the true beauty of wabi sabi lies no in things, but in the very nature of life itself.

- _Wabi sabi is an intuitive response to beauty that reflects the true nature of life._

- _Wabi sabi is an acceptance and appreciation of the impermanent, imperfect and incomplete nature of everything._

- _Wabi sabi is a recognition of the gifts of simple, slow and natural living._
