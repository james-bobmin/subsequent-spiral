## My Second Wisdom Retreival

Published on: 2024-08-26

### This is from the Book: The Pocket Thich Nhat Hanh

### The Buddha

The ocean of suffering is immense, but if you turn around, you can see the land.
The seed of suffering in you may be strong, but don't wait until you have no more suffering before allowing yourself to be happy.
When one tree in the garden is sick, you have to care for it. But don't overlook all the healthy trees.
Even while you have pain in your heart you can enjoy the many wonders of life - the beautiful sunset, the smile of a child, the many flowers and trees.
To suffer is not enough. Please don't be imprisoned by your suffering.

- The Pocket Thich Nhat Hanh
